# Joke generator challenge using 
<br>

- Added an event listener for the button
<br>
- Created a function that will make a request to https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random using the `XMLHttpRequest` object
<br>
- Got the data that is sent back (this.responseText), parse the JSON and get the joke from it
<br>
- Displayed the joke in the page (you can use the `innerHTML` property)
